# JNeuralNetwork
I created this neural network before my (3rd Year 5th-sem) exam, which I was supposed to study for.
A wise programmer(MAN) said, "Do not go simple and straightforward to complete complex work. Instead spend (waste) your time building a library to flex.
Beacause, At the end simple stuff only got work done. Harder things bring 2 times greater satisfaction for yourself".

I am still going to make it a bit more dynamic with having a funcitonality to decided which Activation funciton should be executed for calculating output.
