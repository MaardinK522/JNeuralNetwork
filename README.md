# JNeuralNetwork
I created this neural network before my (third Year 5th-sem) exam, which I was supposed to study for.
A wise programmer (MAN) said, "Do not go simple and straightforward to complete complex work. Instead spend (waste) your time building a library to flex.
Because, in the end, simple stuff only got work done. Harder things bring 2 times greater satisfaction for yourself."

I am still going to make it a bit more dynamic with having a functionality to decide which Activation function should be executed for calculating output.
